# E-commerce Advanced Analytics & BI Dashboard
### 🚀 Market & Customer Intelligence Solution

## Project Overview
This project delivers a high-end Business Intelligence solution using the **theLook eCommerce** dataset. It transcends basic reporting by implementing statistical normalization, geographic intelligence, and behavioral profiling. The end goal is to transform raw cloud-based data into a strategic roadmap for market expansion and customer retention.

## Strategic Objectives
* **Data Architecture:** Streamline extraction from BigQuery using optimized SQL to handle high-volume transactional data.
* **Customer Persona Mapping:** Analyze behavioral patterns (Frequency, Diversity, Spending) to define regional profiles.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Identify logistical and marketing "peak zones" through temporal density analysis.
* **Regional Dominance:** Pinpoint market leadership by state, identifying the drivers of each specific market.

## Tech Stack & Advanced Implementation
* **Engine:** Google BigQuery (Standard SQL)
* **Logic:** Python 3.x (Pandas for data wrangling)
* **Visual Engineering:** Plotly (Express & Graph Objects)
* **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Extensive use of **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Window Functions** (`RANK()`, `PARTITION BY`, `OVER`) for complex multi-dimensional aggregations.

## Key Visualizations & Analytical Depth

### 1. US Market Performance: Revenue & Category Leadership (Choropleth)
* **Analytical Impact:** Provides a geographic "heat" view of revenue while embedding **Category Leadership** via tooltips. This allows executives to identify which product lines dominate specific regions.
* **Technical Highlight:** Implements 90th percentile normalization for color scales to ensure visual contrast across all states.

### 2. Strategic Persona Mapping: Top 5 States (Radar Chart)
* **Analytical Impact:** Compares the "DNA" of the top 5 revenue-generating states. It reveals if a state's performance is driven by high-frequency shoppers or high-ticket luxury buyers.
* **Metrics:** Normalized Total Revenue, Average Ticket, Category Diversity, and Purchase Frequency.
* **Technical Highlight:** Uses **Max-Based Normalization** to ensure all axes are comparable regardless of their original scale.

### 3. Order Density & Staffing Optimization (Heatmap)
* **Analytical Impact:** Visualizes the "heartbeat" of the operation. Essential for scheduling customer support and warehouse shifts based on historical peak hours.

### 4. Half-Yearly Growth Dynamics (Dual-Axis)
* **Analytical Impact:** Correlates User Acquisition (Unique Buyers) with Value (Avg Spend). It answers: "Are we growing by volume or by customer value?"

## Technical Deep Dive: SQL Logic Example
To ensure accuracy, the analysis uses advanced partitioning:
```sql
-- Identifying the #1 category for every state in a single pass
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY u.state ORDER BY COUNT(oi.id) DESC) as category_rank
